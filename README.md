# Narod's FFXV (Final Fantasy 15) Screenshot Grabber

Narod's FFXV Screenshot Grabber is a utility which converts the .ss files output by the game, in to usable .jpg files.

## Background

In FFXV (Final Fantasy 15), Prompto (an in-game character) will take in-game photos of what your party has gotten up to. These are saved by the game in a format which a regular photoviewer does not support. This utility can convert these .ss files in to .jpg files for you.

## Requirements

- .NET 6.0

## Supported Systems

- Windows: 7, 8.1, 10, 11
- Linux: SteamOS (& more, but will require manual browsing to folder)

## Features

- See a live preview of what the .ss file contains before exporting it
- Export a single photo, or an entire folders worth in one go
  - Compared to the most popular FFXV Screenshot Utility, this utility is incredibly fast
- Automatic detection of your screenshot folder, with the option to browse to a custom one
- Realtime mode, which can be activated to save a copy of the screenshots as they are taken in-game.
- Automatic version checker, you will be notified of future updates.

## Limitations

- Auto detection of folders will fail for most Linux (non SteamDeck users), and some Windows users. You can manually browse to the correct location.
