## Background

In FFXV (Final Fantasy 15), Prompto (an in-game character) will take in-game photos of what your party has gotten up to. These are saved by the game in a format which a regular photoviewer does not support. This utility can convert these .ss files in to .jpg files for you.

## Overview

![alt text](img/no_preview.png "The Main Window with No Preview Selected (Image)")

## Requirements

- .NET 6.0

## Supported Systems

- Windows: 7, 8.1, 10, 11
- Linux: SteamOS, & any other distro where Wine works
- macOS: 14.0+ (Sonoma)

## Features

- See a live preview of what the .ss file contains before exporting it
- Export a single photo, or an entire folders worth in one go
  - Compared to the most popular FFXV Screenshot Utility, this utility is incredibly fast
- Automatic multi-platform detection of your screenshot folder, with the option to browse to a custom one
- Realtime mode, which can be activated to save a copy of the screenshots as they are taken in-game.
- Automatic version checker, you will be notified of future updates.

## Limitations

- Images are saved with the same file name as their .ss counterpart, which is just a string of sequential numbers.
- This utility doesn't reset your snapshot in-game file, so you need to sit there and remove all the blank files if you clean out your 'snapshot' folder.
- SteamOS setup is complicated, instructions on Nexus (link above)
